23	Thousand Oaks Nightclub	Long, Ian D.	28/M/W/U/3/M/Y/S/N	Thousand Oaks, CA	11/07/2018	11/0/11	0/0/0	Estimated 175 people on site. Of the 13 reported fatalities, one was police officer (Helus) killed by friendly fire and one was the shooter. Used smoke bombs (3). Official reports say 16 were injured but not from gunfire. 2x Victim intervention attempted. Both died. There is an issue with the math that can be worked out with some calculations/assumptions. Pg. 5 lists 61 rounds fired and 129 remaining rounds which equals a total of 190 rounds. Pg. 25 states that one magazine was found in the weapon with 7 remaining rounds and there was 1 round in the chamber. Pg 26 states that 2x empty magazines, 4x magazines with 24 rounds and 1x magazine with 23 rounds was found. This equals 127 (4*24 + 23 + 7 + 1) which leaves two unfired rounds unaccounted for. However on pg 32 police also found 'some loose ammunition' - if we assume this is two rounds, we can account for all the unfired rounds. We make the assumption that the shooter began with 6x magazines with 24 rounds and 2x magazine with 23 rounds (6*24 + 2*23 = 190) and  that, in the process of replacing magazines, ejected two. With this assumption and knowning the shooter used 3x magazines we have 2 * 24 + 23 = 71. But recall two were ejected and not fired and 8 were left in the weapon and last mag unfired for a total of 10 which subtracted from 71 gives the amount of rounds fired.	2	21.00	K:Self	inside club	Club	IR	P	N	RS	1

96	Northern Illinois University	Kazmierczak, Steven	27/M/W/N/5/A/Y/D/C	DeKalb, IL	02/14/2008	5/21/26	0/0/0	Shooter entered auditorium with 8x loaded magazine. Estimated 100 people on site. Shooter had previously ordered 2x 33-rnd 9mm mags and 2x 15-rnd mags online despite the 17-rnd capacity for the Glock 17 (Did Dekalb Co. or Illinois have a 15-rnd limit?). 55 unexpended rounds found. Some victims excaped during the reload of the shotgun. Police think the 2x loaded .380 magazines and believe they were dropped when shooter attempted to load Glock by mistake. Shooter killed self prior to police arrival. Determined that the 6 other magazines were for the Glock and were 15-rnd mags. The shooter had 8 magazines and 105 pistol rounds (50 fired from the Glock and 55 unexpended). We know that 2 magazines found loaded had .380 ammunition for the Sig Sauer and Hi-Point pistols. The standard capacities are 7-rnd and 8-rnd for 15 total. This leaves 90 which is accounted for with 6*15. Having fired 50 rounds and assuming the weapon was loaded as he entered the auditorium, he needed to switch magazines 3 times.	2	6.00	K:Self	inside auditorium	Auditorium		P	Y, E	RS	4

Shooter used both pistols. Multiple scenes 2/0, 30/17. Expended 174x rounds. Police found 17x empty mags (did not state for which weapon) meaning there 15 magazine changes.

Police found a .460 BA rifle at workdesk and some reports indicate shooter had a pistol. Police found both the AKM Rifle and shotgun with no ammunition. Duffle bag with fully loaded magazines, loose ammunition, shotgun shells and cartridge boxes was also found. CBS and other media reports 60-rnd drum but offical reporting found does not include details on magazine capacities. While the official reports do not discuss the capacity of the magazines found and a Middlesex DA release autoposy report with details on weapons cannot be found, we conclude this is an error in reporting because a 60-rnd drum would have been identified/stated in the reports either by the police or the witness questioned or charges. Issued a MA gun permit in 1989 (after a suicide attempt) which expired in 1998. Left firearms at office night prior to shooting. Investigators believe weapons were purchased prior to weapons permit expiring. Killed four with AKM, and three with both AKM, shotgun. see sentinelandenterprise.com/2013/02/13/in-massachusetts-statistics-blur-gun-control-debate/ all but spanish pistol traced to MA stores.	1		S:Police	inside office-building	Office		P	W, F	RS	4
